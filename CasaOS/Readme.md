## How to Install CasaOS

1. Install `curl` if it's not already installed:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install curl
   ```

2. Run the CasaOS installation script:
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://get.casaos.io | sudo bash
   ```

**Note:** The script will automatically download and install CasaOS. Ensure you trust the source before executing the command.

**Tip:** After installation, you can access CasaOS via its web interface. Check the installation output for the default address and credentials.
