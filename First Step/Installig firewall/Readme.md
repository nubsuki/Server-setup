### Steps to Install UFW:

1. **Update the package list:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```

2. **Install UFW:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt install ufw
   ```

3. **Check the status to confirm installation:**
   ```bash
   sudo ufw status
   ```

   If UFW is inactive, youâ€™ll see:
   ```plaintext
   Status: inactive
   ```

### Enable UFW:

1. **Enable the firewall:**
   ```bash
   sudo ufw enable
   ```

   You'll be prompted to confirm. Type `y` and press Enter.

2. **Allow specific services or ports (optional):**
   For example, to allow SSH:
   ```bash
   sudo ufw allow ssh
   ```

3. **Verify UFW is active and running:**
   ```bash
   sudo ufw status
   ```

### Allow SSH Access to All Local Devices

To allow all devices in your local network to access the SSH server, use the following command:

```bash
sudo ufw allow from 192.168.1.0/24
```
Replace `192.168.1.0/24` with your network's IP range.

### Remove a Port or Rule in UFW

1. **Check the current UFW rules:**
   ```bash
   sudo ufw status numbered
   ```

2. **Delete a rule by its number:**
   ```bash
   sudo ufw delete X
   ```
   Replace `X` with the rule number.

   For example, to delete rule #3:
   ```bash
   sudo ufw delete 3
   ```

3. **Verify the updated UFW rules:**
   ```bash
   sudo ufw status
   ```

### Important Notes:

- **Firewall Rules:** Always double-check your firewall rules to ensure you're not unintentionally blocking necessary services.
- **Testing Connectivity:** After making changes to UFW, it's important to test connectivity to ensure everything is working as expected.
