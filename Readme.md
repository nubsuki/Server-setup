# How to Set Up a Linux Server Guide

This is a simple server setup guide for future reference. It covers various steps and software configurations to get your Linux server up and running. The steps are designed for Debian-based systems (Ubuntu, Debian).

## First Step: Initial Setup

Before diving into more advanced server configurations, follow these initial steps to secure and prepare your system:

1. **Update Your System**: 
   Ensure your system is up-to-date to get the latest security patches and updates.

2. **Change the Default SSH Port**: 
   For better security, change the default SSH port from 22 to a custom number.

3. **Configure the Firewall (UFW)**: 
   Set up a firewall to control incoming and outgoing traffic and allow only necessary services.

4. **Set Up Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: 
   Secure your server with 2FA to add an extra layer of protection.
